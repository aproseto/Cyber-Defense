# Cyber Defense

## Objective
The Cyber Defense Learning Path from TryHackMe aims to give an introduction to skills needed to detect and respond to various threats. The primary focus was learning about Threat and Vulnerability Management, Security Operations & Monitoring, Threat Emulation, Incident Response & Forensics, and Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering. This hands-on experience is crucial in getting practice with more tools that will be utilized in the workplace and provided in-depth learning on components of detecting and responding to threats from a comporate environment.

### Skills Learned
- Networking Theory and Tools.
- Enumerating and exploiting network services and misconfigurations.
- Network Protocols such as ARP, ICMP, TCP, DNS, and HTTP/S.
- Windows Fundamentals including NTFS File System, Control Panel, UAC.
- Basic concepts and functions of Active Directory.
- Knowledge on available MITRE Resources.

- How to create SQL queries with OSQuery.
- Kerberos authentication and how its Ticket Granting Service can be abused.
- Different forms of Digital Forensic investigations.
- Different types of malware and how they can be reverse engineered to provide information on attackers.

### Tools Used
- Windows CMD/Powershell to enumerate, use programs, parse through data, investigate malware strings, and read files.
- Wireshark to analyze protocols and PCAPs.
- Nessus to run a network scan and interpret results.
